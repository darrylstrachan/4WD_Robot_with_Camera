# 4WD Robot (with camera)

This is a fun python project which allows a user to remotely control a 4WD robot using the raspberry pi zero W. This project was implemented using a 4 motor chassis found on amazon.com but can be modified to meet the needs of any number of motors. A fair amount of comfort with electronics, wiring of components, etc. is required.
